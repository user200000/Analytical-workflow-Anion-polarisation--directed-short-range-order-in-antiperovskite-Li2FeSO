## Summary


This repository contains the analytical workflow for our preprint entitled "Anion-polarisation--directed short-range-order" in antiperovskite Li2FeSO [LINK GOES HERE].The workflow consits of three main componanents. Fitting, Enumeration and Monte Carlo (MC), which are each applied to coulombic and cluster expansion system. A random arangement of particles is also generated for comparison with the monte carlo. There are three main subsections of the workflow fitting, mc, and enumeration each will be described breifly there is a workflow diagram at the base of the page. I conda yaml file is provided describing the exact environments in which calculations were intially run.

## Summary

Fitting all subsequent calculations are performed using the icet library

An associted dataset will be made available with DFT calculations on the bath university archive.
